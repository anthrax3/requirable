Mocks the require command to include the current package when the `name` from the current `package.json` is required.

Uses `process.cwd()` to find the current `package.json` so this is only meant to be used as a dev dependency for testing. This will not work on a published package!

## Install

```shell
npm install --save-dev requireable
```

## Usage

```js
require('requirable');
// That's it! `require` has now been patched

const myPackage = require('package-name')
```

## AVA Usage

Some tests runners such as [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) can require packages automatically for you. If you're using AVA add the following to your package.json:

```json
"ava": {
  "require": [
    "requireable"
  ]
},
 ```

 You can now `require` (or `import`) your package in your AVA tests by name.

 e.g instead of:

 ```js
 import test from 'ava';
 import myPackage from '../';
 ```

 You can now do:

 ```js
 import test from 'ava';
 import myPackage from 'package-name';
 ```
